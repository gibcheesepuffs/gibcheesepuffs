### Hi there 👋

いらっしゃいみんな! I am [Shouko](https://linktr.ee/shoukolate), a power user interested in computing, free speech, anime, and a lot more. I am a strong proponent of free software and like the ideas of cypherpunk. I have written software for various platforms including Android, SailfishOS and Ubuntu Touch.
