### Hi there 👋

いらっしゃいみんな! My preferred name is [Shoko](https://linktr.ee/shoukolate). I am an engineer interested in computing, self-hosting, anime, and a lot more. I am a strong proponent of free software and like the ideas of cypherpunk. I have written software for various platforms including Android, SailfishOS and Ubuntu Touch.

- 🔭 I’m constantly improving my Python, Linux, InfoSec, DevOps, AWS and self hosting skills.
